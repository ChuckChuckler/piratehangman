# Pirate Hangman
Project made for Hack Club's SayCheese, made to fit entirely in a QR code after minification/data-uri-ification

I HATE THIS PROJECT >:(\
Well, no, I don't actually hate it. I'm just exaggerating to be honest.\
Honestly, this was actually really difficult. The size constraint makes it impossible to make something that's really good, so I had to settle for "good enough" (something that is usually the DEATH OF ME in any given scenario).\
Anyways, this entire project is just a typical hangman game and a typical player-moves-around-while-things-fall-from-the-sky game (what's it called?? who even knows) smashed together and crushed with a hydraulic press to fit an < 2.9kb data uri constraint. I didn't want to just make something simple and pick either-or, so I decided to merge them into one! I hope that's at least a little more creative than a standalone hangman game or the other thing.\ 
I do wish I could've made it look a little better (since most of my projects focus a lot on CSS nowadays), but hey, I did the most I could. Just this alone is around 2.89kb or something. Yeah, this was HARD.

## How to Play
A chosen word (pirate-related!) will show up onscreen with its letters blanked out. (It's hangman!)\
Use your cursor to drag around the little dark box at the bottom of the screen, and catch the falling letters!\
If you catch a letter and it's in the word, it'll show up in its respective position(s).\
Otherwise, it'll be counted as an incorrect guess, and will be displayed at the top of the screen.\
Five incorrect guesses means game over!\
To play again, just reload the page (not enough space to implement a proper replay button...)

## Installation
The entire project is literally just one HTML file, so just download it and run it and you should be fine.
